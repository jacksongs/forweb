  <p><small><strong>About</strong><br>
  Each year the National Assessment Program for Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) assesses all students in Australian schools in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9 across five domains - reading, writing, and numeracy, spelling, and grammar and punctuation.<br>
This table lists schools in South Australia and their average NAPLAN scores. The figures are averages of the five NAPLAN scores for each year in each school, from the Government's <a href="http://myschool.edu.au">MySchool website</a>.<br>
The information in these tables was collected in March to give South Australians a way to compare the state's schools. Schools were included if they were listed on MySchool with a South Australian postcode. <strong>School year results missing a score for one or more domains were excluded</strong>.
If you believe your school is missing please email gothesnapen@news.com.au.</small></p>
