<p><small><strong>GLOSSARY</strong><br>
<strong>Rank</strong> - Schools are ranked by their 2015 average scores across all test categories.<br>
<strong>School Sector</strong> - Government or non-government school.<br>
<strong>Enrolments</strong> - Number of full-time equivalent enrolments.<br>
<strong>ICSEA Value</strong> - ICSEA stands for Index of Community Socio-Educational Advantage. It is a scale developed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority allowing for fair comparisons among schools with similar students. The average value is 1000, with values above 1000 indicating advantage and below 1000 disadvantage. Factors include parents' occupations and level of education, school location and proportion of indigenous students.<br>
<strong>Income per student</strong> - Total school income per student including state and federal funding, fees paid by parents and other income sources. </small></p>

  <p><small><strong>ABOUT</strong><br>
  The National Assessment Program - Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) is an annual assessment for students in Years 3, 5, 7 and 9. It is overseen by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority and began in 2008. The tests are taken in May. Students have scores recorded in five areas - reading, writing, spelling, grammar and punctuation, and numeracy.<br>
An analysis of 2015 results by The Advertiser, using data from the federal <a href="http://myschool.edu.au">MySchool website</a>, has ranked schools according to their average score across all test areas. The average NAPLAN scores of all schools in Australia for each year level are: year 9 - 574, year 7 - 538, year 5 - 444 and year 3 - 416.<br>
This table lists schools in South Australia and their average NAPLAN scores. The figures are averages of the five NAPLAN scores for each year in each school.
Schools were included if they were listed on MySchool with a South Australian postcode. <strong>School year results missing a score for one or more domains were excluded</strong>.

If you believe your school is missing please email gothesnapen@news.com.au.</small></p>
